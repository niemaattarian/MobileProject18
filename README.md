# OverView
My third year mobile application project consisted of creating a cross platform application using Xamarin and Visual studios which deploys to Android, iOS and Windows (Universal Windows Platform). The application incorporates a well designed UI that is fit for the purpose and provides a good user experience and uses data storage (JSON). My application is a music application which allow users to creat artists, delete and append them in a list view.
